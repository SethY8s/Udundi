###Udundi test

This is my attempt at the Undundi coding challenge. It took me about 2 day to finish. The first day was, working on making the header for desktop, then working on the animation. The second day included finihsing up the animation, and making the website responsive. Please note, that in the code there are several exlpanations of what the code does/ why I did it a certain way. In a real project, some of these would not be there, however general formatting notes would still be included.
